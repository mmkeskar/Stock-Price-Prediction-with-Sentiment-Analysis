# Stock Price Prediction with Sentiment Analysis

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to be able to predict stock prices effectively using the market sentiment for the day and the LSTM predictions.
There seems to be a [correlation](https://github.com/mmkeskar/Stock-Analysis-with-NLP) in the market sentiment for a particular day that is calculated based on the twitter comments collected everyday pertaining to the companies whose stocks we are considering (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and Tesla). This means that the difference in the LSTM and ARMIA predictions can be expalined by the sentiment calculated from the twitter comments. This project aims to verify those findings.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
